Soul Filcher's Foraging Time
By Soul Filcher, 2019.
Downloaded from Steam Workshop.

This mod adds some unused items found in Zomboid files. It also adds variety to loot spawns for containers and zombies. As I keep
making additions and changes to this mod I may add more uses to existing items.

Work in progress, so things may look unfinished and not work 100% as intended.

-Cockroach: The world is theirs now, so they can be found in several places.
