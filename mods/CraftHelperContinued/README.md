# Craft Helper for build 41.65+

This is an updated version of "[Craft Helper (41.x) by b1n0m](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2186592938)" with improved UI.

## Original description:

> _Originally posted by **b1n0m**_
>
> > This mod will add a "Craft Helper 41" context menu item when right-clicking on any item in your inventory or a container.
> > Selecting that will bring up a dialogue of every recipe that that item is part of. Selecting a recipe will show the recipe components and what is already obtained by the player and what needs to be obtained, as well as quantities.
> >
> > The mod in many cases reuses string resources from the core UI, so it supports all game languages.
> >
> > If you play with Hydrocraft, you definitely need this modðŸ˜‰
